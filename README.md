HelloðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Currently, I'm working on a 2D game in Unity using C#.
- ðŸŒ± I'm focusing on developing object-oriented programming skills and .NET technologies.
- ðŸ‘¯ I am eager to tackle new challenges both as part of a team and independently.
- âœ¨ I'm looking for opportunities to showcase my skills, develop my abilities, and explore new horizons as a young programmer.
- ðŸ’¬ I excel at problem-solving and finding answers to questions that intrigue me on the internet, yet I'm not afraid to ask questions myself.
- ðŸ“« I encourage you to contact me via email address: jkaczmarzewski@edu.cdv.pl.
